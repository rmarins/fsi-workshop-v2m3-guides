* https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces^] - based on *Eclipse Che*, it’s a cloud-based, in-browser IDE (similar to IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, Eclipse IDE). You’ve been provisioned your own personal workspace for use with this workshop. You’ll write, test, and deploy code from here.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhamt[Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit^] - You’ll use this to migrate an existing application
* https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^] - a collection of cloud-native runtimes like Spring Boot, Node.js, and https://quarkus.io[Quarkus^]

You’ll be provided clickable URLs throughout the workshop to access the services that have been installed for you.

== How to complete this workshop

Simply follow these instructions end-to-end. *You'll need to do quite a bit of copy/paste for Linux commands and source code modifications*, as well as clicking around on various consoles used in the labs. When you get to the end of each section, you can click the "Next >" button at the bottom to advance to the next topic. You can also use the menu on the left to move around the instructions at will.

The entire workshop is split into one or more _modules_ - Look at the top of the screen in the header to see which module you are on. After you complete this module, your instructor may have additional modules to complete.

Good luck, and let’s get started!
